# Azure
You'll need an Azure subscription to host various services that are created during the day. If you already have an Azure subscription, you can use that and skip this step (the costs for all the labs today is small).

If you don't already have Azure (or want your own subscription just for today), you can get a creditcard-free trial by following these steps.

We have limited numbers of trial codes and so you should only claim one if you need one. You can also sign-up for a trial using https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free/, this gives you Â£150 credit but requires credit card details for verification purposes.

If you don't have an existing subscription and are not willing to use your credit card as a security verification, please go ahead.
